### Nested function's scope 
- Block Scope - Bariables declared inside a pair of curly braces cannot be accessed from outside the block
- Function Scope - variables declared inside a function cannot be accessed from outside the function
- Global Scope - Globally scoped variables can be accessed inside a block or function but can not overide block scopes

** Nested functions have access to it's own scope as well as it's outer scope.
