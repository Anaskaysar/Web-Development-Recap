### Variables
Recomanded ways to declare variables
- Using let
- Using var
Difference between these two.
- All const declaration must be declarations must be initialized and once initialized it can not be reassigned. If any const vairable is declared without assigning values it it give error "Missing initializer in const declaration". On the other hand if one try to change values of constant variablw after assigning value it will give "TypeError :  Assignment to constant variable".
- let can be declared with or without assigning values. There wont be any issues.

<b>Thumb Rule: Always use "const" declarations unless the value is going to be changed. </b>
